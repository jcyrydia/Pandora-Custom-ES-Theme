Usage

The theme requires the latest version of Emulationstation to work.  Download the latest emulationstation-dev package from experimental packages in the retropie setup.

This theme is designed for a 1920x1080 display but should fuction at other resolution with some minor alignment issues.

For best results set EmulationStation to use Instant transitions. (MAIN MENU/UI SETTINGS/TRANSITION STYLE = INSTANT)

You can modify some settings in the config.xml file. The available options are:


SCALING: 'image-fit' or 'image-stretch'. Affects how preview images/videos are scaled. 'image-fit' will maintain the aspect ratio of the image.  'image-stretch' will stretch the image to fill the entire preview window.  Default is 'image-fit'.


Colour styles
-----------------------------------
Included with the theme are a set of 18 folders which if placed alongside the main pandora theme folder will allow you to select any of the 18 colour styles from within EmulationStation.
Alternatively you can manually enter the colour.xml file to choose your desired colour (see the 'pandora colour guide.jpg' for available options ).
